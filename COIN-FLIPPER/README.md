### Component Architecture

The application follows a clean, modular architecture:

- **App.jsx**: Main application component that serves as the root container
- **Home.jsx**: Primary page component containing all coin flipping logic and UI
- **Home.css**: Comprehensive stylesheet with advanced CSS animations and responsive design

### State Management

The application uses React's built-in `useState` hook for efficient state management:

```javascript
const [isFlipping, setIsFlipping] = useState(false)      // Animation state
const [result, setResult] = useState(null)               // Current flip result
const [tails, setTails] = useState(0)                    // Tails counter
const [heads, setHeads] = useState(0)                    // Heads counter
const [totalFlips, setTotalFlips] = useState(0)          // Total flips counter
const [showStats, setShowStats] = useState(false)       // Statistics panel visibility
const [flipHistory, setFlipHistory] = useState([])      // Recent flips array
```

### Animation System

The 3D coin flip animation is implemented using advanced CSS transforms and keyframes:

```css
@keyframes coinFlip {
  0% { transform: rotateY(0deg) rotateX(0deg); }
  25% { transform: rotateY(450deg) rotateX(180deg) scale(1.1); }
  50% { transform: rotateY(900deg) rotateX(360deg) scale(1.2); }
  75% { transform: rotateY(1350deg) rotateX(540deg) scale(1.1); }
  100% { transform: rotateY(1800deg) rotateX(720deg) scale(1); }
}
```

## 🎨 Design System

```css
@keyframes coinFlip {
  /* Modify these values to change animation behavior */
  0% { transform: rotateY(0deg) rotateX(0deg); }
  /* Add more keyframes for complex animations */
  100% { transform: rotateY(1800deg) rotateX(720deg) scale(1); }
}
```

### Changing Colors

Update the CSS custom properties or gradient values in `Home.css`:

```css
.coin-side.heads {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #your-color-1, #your-color-2);
