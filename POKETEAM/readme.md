# Pokémon Team Builder App

This is a simple web application built with React and Vite that allows users to create and manage their Pokémon teams. It provides a user-friendly interface to select Pokémon, view their details, and assemble a balanced team for battles or collection.



## Technologies Used

*   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Vite**: A fast build tool that provides a lightning-fast development experience.
*   **npm**: Node.js package manager for managing project dependencies.
*   **HTML5**: For structuring the web content.
*   **CSS3**: For styling the web application.



## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```
    (Replace `<repository_url>` and `<repository_name>` with your actual repository details.)

2.  **Install NPM packages**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command will install all the necessary dependencies listed in `package.json`.



## Running the App

To run the application in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the application in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
