2. **Vercel**: Connect your repository for automatic deployments
3. **GitHub Pages**: Use GitHub Actions for automated deployment
4. **Traditional Hosting**: Upload the `dist` folder contents to your web server

### Environment Variables
If you need to add environment variables:
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tips

### Code Organization
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Organize imports: React imports first, then third-party, then local imports

### Performance Optimization
- Images are optimized and properly sized
- Components use React best practices
- Tailwind CSS is purged in production builds
- Lazy loading can be added for images if needed

### Adding Animations
The project uses Framer Motion for animations. To add new animations:
```jsx
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'

const MyComponent = () => (
  <motion.div
    initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
    animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
    transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
  >
    Content here
  </motion.div>
)
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Development server won't start**
- Ensure Node.js version is 18.0 or higher
- Delete `node_modules` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`, then run `pnpm install` again
- Check if port 5173 is already in use

**Images not loading**
- Verify image paths are correct relative to the `src` directory
- Ensure images exist in the `src/assets/images/` directory
- Check browser console for 404 errors

**Styling issues**
- Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured
- Check that custom CSS doesn't conflict with Tailwind classes
- Verify PostCSS configuration is correct

**Build errors**
- Run `npm run lint` to check for code issues
- Ensure all imports are correct and files exist
- Check for TypeScript errors if using TypeScript

### Getting Help
If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
3. Ensure you're using the correct Node.js version
4. Review the Vite documentation for build-related issues
