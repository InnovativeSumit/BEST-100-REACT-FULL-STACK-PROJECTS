# Fruit Matcher Game

## Description

This is a simple and engaging memory matching game built with React. The objective of the game is to match pairs of identical fruit emojis hidden behind tiles. Players flip two tiles at a time, and if the fruits match, the tiles remain revealed, and the player earns a point. If they don't match, the tiles flip back over after a short delay, challenging the player's memory to remember their positions. The game features a score tracker and a reset option to start a new game at any time.


## Features

*   **Interactive Game Board:** A grid of tiles that can be clicked to reveal hidden fruit emojis.
*   **Memory Matching Logic:** Implements core game mechanics for matching pairs and handling mismatches.
*   **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of the player's successful matches.
*   **Game Reset:** Allows players to restart the game at any time, shuffling the fruits for a new challenge.
*   **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS for a visually appealing and adaptable interface across different devices.




## Technologies Used

*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Vite:** A fast build tool that provides a lightning-fast development experience.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
*   **ESLint:** A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code.
